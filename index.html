		<h2>Sebastian Nanclares</h2>
		<p>My Name is Sebastian, I am 15 years old, and I am currently going to Baruch College for a summer program on computing. I speak both English and Spanish. I am iterested in coding and different computing languages, since this is what all technolgy today is based of. I am currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript as a start.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I look foward to mastering HTML, CSS, and Javascript by the end of the year.</li>
				<li>I also look foward to creating a simple website for my final presentation of the Summer Porgram</li>
			</ul>
